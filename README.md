## Interactive FLIP fluid simulator in Python & PyGame!
### (Written for the Boot.dev 2025 Hackathon)

This is a simple interactive Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) simulator written in Python.
I have had the idea of playing around with something 'tactile' like this, but have always been put off by the learning curve to write something like this.

However, after some fantastic videos from 10 Minute Papers on these fluid simulation topics, I have decided to give it a crack for the 2025 Boot.dev hackathon!
